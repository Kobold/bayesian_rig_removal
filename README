EECS 442 Project - Rig Removal

Necessary python libraries:
OpenCV python bindings
SciPy

Two inputs are needed to do rig removal:
1. Input PNG movie frames in the "Forest_Gump" directory.
2. The rig region for each frame in "rig_data.txt". Each line is for a single
   frame and each x,y pair specifies a vertex for the polygon surrounding the
   rig.

To actually do the rig removal:
1. Run "python optical_flow.py". It uses LK optical flow to determine the motion
   between pairs of frames.
2. Run "python main.py". Using the given images, rig region vertices, and optical
   flow displacements--main.py does the actual job of rig removal. The final
   output frames will be created in a directory "out".
